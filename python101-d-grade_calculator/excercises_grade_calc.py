"""
Certainly! I'll be happy to guide you through this Python code step by step, starting from the basics. Let's begin with the fundamentals and gradually build up to the complete function. We'll use exercises and examples to reinforce each concept.

Let's start with the very basics:

1. Variables and Data Types

In Python, we use variables to store data. The basic data types we'll use in this example are:
- Integers (int): Whole numbers
- Strings (str): Text
- None: Represents the absence of a value

Exercise 1:
Create a variable called 'score' and assign it the value 85.

Please provide your answer, and I'll review it before we move on.
"""

score = 85

"""
Excellent! Your answer is correct. Let's break it down:

score = 85

- You've created a variable named 'score'
- You've assigned it the integer value 85
- In Python, we use the '=' operator for assignment

This is a perfect example of creating an integer variable. Now, let's move on to the next concept.

2. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)

Conditional statements allow us to make decisions in our code based on certain conditions.

Exercise 2:
Using the 'score' variable you just created, write an if-elif-else statement to assign a letter grade based on the score. Use the following grading scale:
90 or above: 'A'
80-89: 'B'
70-79: 'C'
60-69: 'D'
Below 60: 'F'

Store the result in a variable called 'grade'.

Please write your code, and I'll review it.
"""
score = 85  # Let's use the original score we set
grade = ""  # Initialize an empty string to store the grade

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"  # This was mistakenly set to "A" in your version
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"  # We don't need a condition here, it's the default case

print(f"The grade is: {grade}")


"""
Your attempt is on the right track, but there are a few issues to address. Let's correct and improve it:

```python
score = 85  # Let's use the original score we set
grade = ""  # Initialize an empty string to store the grade

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"  # This was mistakenly set to "A" in your version
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"  # We don't need a condition here, it's the default case

print(f"The grade is: {grade}")
```

Here are the corrections and explanations:

1. We kept the original `score = 85` instead of changing it to 0.
2. We initialize a `grade` variable to store the result.
3. We use `grade = ` instead of `return`. The `return` statement is used to exit a function and provide a value back to the caller. Here, we're just assigning a value to a variable.
4. In the second `elif`, we corrected "A" to "B".
5. In the `else` clause, we don't need a condition. It automatically catches all cases not covered by the previous conditions.
6. We removed `f` before the string in the assignments, as it's not needed for simple string assignments.
7. At the end, we added a print statement to display the result.

This structure correctly implements the grading logic you described. Now, when you run this code with `score = 85`, it will output:

```
The grade is: B
```

Let's practice this concept a bit more. 

Exercise 3:
Modify the code to handle invalid scores (below 0 or above 100). If the score is invalid, set the grade to "Invalid". Then print the result.

Please try to implement this modification, and I'll review your answer.
"""

score = 85  # Let's use the original score we set
grade = ""  # Initialize an empty string to store the grade

if score < 0 or score > 100:  # This is the correct condition for invalid scores
    grade = "Invalid"
elif score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(f"The grade is: {grade}")

"""
The main correction is in the first condition:

You used if score <= 0 and score >= 100:, which is logically impossible (a number cannot be both less than or equal to 0 AND greater than or equal to 100 at the same time).
The correct condition is if score < 0 or score > 100:. This checks if the score is either less than 0 OR greater than 100.

Remember:

Use and when both conditions must be true.
Use or when at least one of the conditions must be true.

Now, this code will correctly handle invalid scores. Let's test it:
"""

# Test cases
scores = [85, 95, 75, 65, 55, 100, 0, -5, 105]

for score in scores:
    grade = ""
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        grade = "Invalid"
    elif score >= 90:
        grade = "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        grade = "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        grade = "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        grade = "D"
    else:
        grade = "F"
    
    print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")

# This will output:

"""
Score: 85, Grade: B
Score: 95, Grade: A
Score: 75, Grade: C
Score: 65, Grade: D
Score: 55, Grade: F
Score: 100, Grade: A
Score: 0, Grade: F
Score: -5, Grade: Invalid
Score: 105, Grade: Invalid
"""

"""
Great job on getting most of this correct! The concept of handling edge cases (like invalid inputs) is crucial in programming.
Now, let's move on to the next concept. We'll look at functions, which are a way to package and reuse code.
Exercise 4:
Convert your grading logic into a function named calculate_grade that takes a score as an argument and returns the corresponding grade. Then, call this function with different scores and print the results.
Please try to implement this function, and I'll review your answer.
"""

def calculate_grade(score):
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid"
    elif score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

# Test the function with different scores
scores = [85, 95, 75, 65, 55, 100, 0, -5, 105]

for score in scores:
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")

"""
Great job! You've successfully created a function to calculate grades. Your implementation is very close to being perfect. Let's make a few small adjustments to improve it:
pythonCopydef calculate_grade(score):
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid"
    elif score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

# Test the function with different scores
scores = [85, 95, 75, 65, 55, 100, 0, -5, 105]

for score in scores:
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")
Explanation of the changes:

In the function, we directly return the grade instead of assigning it to a variable first. This makes the function more concise.
We removed the global grade variable. It's not needed because the function returns the grade, and we assign this returned value when we call the function.
We moved the scores list definition before the loop that uses it.
We removed the final print(scores) and print(f"The grade is: {grade}") lines, as they were not necessary for this exercise.

Your implementation of the function logic is correct, and you've done a great job of using it in a loop to test multiple scores.
Now, let's move on to the next concept: handling user input.

Exercise 5:
Modify your program to ask the user to input a score, then use your calculate_grade function to determine and print the grade. Make sure to handle the case where the user inputs something that's not a valid number.
Here's a hint to get you started:
"""
def calculate_grade(score):
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid"
    elif score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

try:
    score = int(input("Enter a score: "))
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

"""
Explanation of the changes:

We moved the calculate_grade function definition to the top of the script. It's a good practice to define functions before using them.
We put the grade = calculate_grade(score) and the print statement inside the try block. This ensures that we only try to calculate and print the grade if the input was successfully converted to an integer.

This implementation now correctly handles both valid numeric inputs and invalid inputs (like letters or symbols).
To further improve this program, we could add a loop to allow the user to enter multiple scores until they choose to quit. Let's do that as our next exercise.

Exercise 6:
Modify your program to repeatedly ask for scores until the user enters 'q' to quit. Use a while loop to accomplish this.
Here's a hint to get you started:

"""
print("##################this is a brea #############")
def calculate_grade(score):
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid"
    elif score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

while True:
    user_input = input("Enter a score (or 'q' to quit): ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'q':
        print("Thank you for using the grade calculator. Goodbye!")
        break
    
    try:
        score = int(user_input)
        grade = calculate_grade(score)
        print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
"""
Here are the main changes and explanations:

We removed the second input() call inside the try block. We're already getting the user's input with user_input = input("Enter a score (or 'q' to quit): "), so we don't need to ask for it again.
Instead of calling int(input(...)), we now use int(user_input). This converts the user's input to an integer.
We added a goodbye message when the user quits the program.
The calculate_grade() function remains unchanged and correct.

This implementation now correctly loops, allowing the user to enter multiple scores until they choose to quit. It also properly handles both numeric inputs and the quit command, while catching any invalid inputs.
Let's test this with a few inputs to make sure it works as expected:
"""
    # Rest of your code here
"""
Enter a score (or 'q' to quit): 85
Score: 85, Grade: B
Enter a score (or 'q' to quit): 95
Score: 95, Grade: A
Enter a score (or 'q' to quit): 75
Score: 75, Grade: C
Enter a score (or 'q' to quit): abc
Invalid input. Please enter a number.
Enter a score (or 'q' to quit): 105
Score: 105, Grade: Invalid
Enter a score (or 'q' to quit): q
Thank you for using the grade calculator. Goodbye!
"""

"""
Great job! You've successfully created a functional grade calculator that can handle multiple inputs and gracefully deal with invalid inputs.
Now, let's move on to the final step: incorporating this into a function that can handle web requests, similar to the original code you provided. This will involve working with Flask, a popular Python web framework.
Exercise 7:
Convert your grade calculator into a function that can handle web requests. Use the following template:
"""

from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string

app = Flask(__name__)

def calculate_grade(score):
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid"
    elif score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

@app.route('/grades', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def grades():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        score = request.form.get('score')
        if score is not None:
            try:
                score = int(score)
                grade = calculate_grade(score)
                return render_template_string("""
                    <h1>Your grade is: {{grade}}</h1>
                    <a href="/grades">Calculate another grade</a>
                """, grade=grade)
            except ValueError:
                return "Invalid input. Please enter a number.", 400
    
    # If it's a GET request or if no score was provided in POST
    return render_template_string("""
        <h1>Grade Calculator</h1>
        <form method="post">
            <input type="number" name="score" placeholder="Enter score">
            <input type="submit" value="Calculate Grade">
        </form>
    """)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

"""
Let's break down the changes:

We moved calculate_grade() outside of the grades() function, as it doesn't need to be redefined on each request.
We removed the while loop. In a web application, each request is handled separately, so we don't need a loop.
We're using request.method to determine if it's a GET or POST request.
For GET requests, we return an HTML form for the user to input their score.
For POST requests, we retrieve the score from request.form['score'], calculate the grade, and return an HTML page with the result.
We're using render_template_string() to generate HTML responses. In a larger application, you'd typically use separate HTML template files.
We're handling the ValueError exception and returning an error message with a 400 status code if the input is invalid.

This implementation now works as a web application. When you run this script and navigate to http://localhost:5000/grades in your web browser, you'll see a form where you can enter a score. After submitting, it will display the calculated grade.
To test this:

Save this code in a file (e.g., app.py).
Install Flask if you haven't already: pip install flask
Run the script: python app.py
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000/grades

You should now have a functional web-based grade calculator! This implementation closely mirrors the structure of the original code you provided, adapted for a simpler use case.60

"""




"""
Key changes:

Removed the while loop. In a web application, each request is handled separately.
Used request.form.get('score') to safely get the score from the form data.
Moved the form rendering outside the if-else block, so it's returned for GET requests or when no score is provided in a POST request.
Ensured that all code paths in the function return a response.

This version should work correctly without throwing the TypeError. When you run this and navigate to http://localhost:5000/grades, you should see a form where you can enter a score. After submitting, it will display the calculated grade or an error message if the input is invalid.
Remember to save this code in a file (e.g., app.py), ensure Flask is installed (pip install flask), and then run the script (python app.py). Then open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000/grades to test it.
