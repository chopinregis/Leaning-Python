### Concept: Variables
### Variables in Python are used to store data values. Python has no command for declaring a variable; you create a variable the moment you first assign a value to it.

# Declaring variables
x = 10  # An integer assignment
y = "Hello, Python!"  # A string assignment

### Exercise 7: Variables
### Create two variables: city and population. Assign "New York" to city and 8419000 to population. Then, use a print statement to output a message like "The population of New York is 8419000."

city = "New York"
population = 8419000

print(f"The population of {city} is {population}")
