### Concept: String Formatting
### Python provides several methods to format strings, making it easier to create structured and visually appealing outputs. Key methods include old style % formatting, the str.format() method, and f-strings (formatted string literals), which are very versatile and efficient.

name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")


### Exercise 12: String Formatting
### Create a string using an f-string that includes variables for a person's name, age, and favorite color. Use the following values: name = "Bob", age = 24, favorite color = "blue". Print a sentence like "Bob is 24 years old and loves the color blue."

name = "Bob"
age = 24
favorite_color = "blue"
print(f"{name} is {age} years old and loves the color {favorite_color}")
