### Concept: Loops
### Loops in Python allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. The for loop is especially useful for iterating over a sequence (like a list or a range).

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

### This loop will print the numbers 0 through 4.

### Exercise 4
### Write a for loop that iterates through the numbers 1 to 5 (inclusive) and prints each number.

for i in range(1, 6):
	print(i)
