### Concept: Casting
### Casting in Python is when you convert a variable value from one type to another. This is often used with Python's built-in types like int(), str(), float(), and set().

# Converting an integer to a string
x = 10
y = str(x)
print(y)  # Outputs "10" as a string

### Exercise 5: Casting
### Convert the number 24.5 to an integer and print the result. Also, try converting the string "100" to an integer.

num = 24.5
num_int = int(num)
print(num_int)

num = "100"
num_int = int(num)
print(num_int)
