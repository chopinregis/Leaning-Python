### Concept: Modulo Operator
### The modulo operator % is used in Python to find the remainder of a division between two numbers.

result = 7 % 3
print(result)  # Outputs 1 because 7 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1

### Exercise 5
### Use the modulo operator to check if the number 18 is even or odd, and print "Even" if it's even, and "Odd" if it's odd.

num = 18
if num % 2 == 0:
	print(f"the number {num} is even")
else:
	print(f"the number {num} is odd")


num = 21
if num % 2 == 0:
	print(f"the number {num} is even")
else:
	print(f"the number {num} is odd")
