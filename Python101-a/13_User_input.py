### Concept: User Input
### User input in Python can be obtained using the input() function, which pauses the program's execution and waits for the user to type something into the console, returning the input as a string.

# Getting user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

### Exercise 8: User Input
### For this exercise, write a program that asks the user for their favorite color and then prints a message saying what that color is. For instance, if they input "blue", the program should print "Your favorite color is blue."

color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
print(f"Your favorite color is {color}")
